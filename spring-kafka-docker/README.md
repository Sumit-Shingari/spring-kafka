In this project we are creating both kafka producer and consumer in the same application. 

The zookerper and the kafka broker service is managed through docker container.

Both the services for zookeper and kafka broker/server is managed through docker-compose.

To run this application we first need to start the docker compose and then run the application. 
Further we can process the kafka application using the endpoints provided in the application.

For any further query and feedback please mail me on my email id : sumit007shingari@gmail.com
